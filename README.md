# 👋 Hi, I’m Rae.  
Or Kam Siew Hui, for those who know me by my Chinese name 😉.

🎯 Currently building: **30-Day Python Challenge**  
🧪 Making weird, useless, (hopefully fun) programs in Python — one day at a time.  
🎨 Challenging my **creativity**, ideas, and sense of humor

> I’m not a coding genius. Just figuring life out by building things I love.

### 💻 30-Day Python Challenge

I’m challenging myself to build as many small Python applications as I can in 30 days — fun, interactive, or just weirdly satisfying — and I’m sharing everything I build.
